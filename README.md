# MOC "Black Cat"

In 1996 LEGO released the set 5571 Giant Truck / Black Cat. 
This was a great set of Model Team.

The Giant Truck is an American truck with a long engine hood 
and a sleeping cabin for the driver. 

The model has steering, a hinged engine hood, driver and 
passenger doors can be opened and tool boxes that can also be
opened.

In 1996 there were many parts that are not available today. 
The front axle, in particular, has bent badly after many years 
on the shelf under the weight of the model and no longer looked 
beautiful. For this reason I decided to redesign the entire chassis. 
In addition, the truck is to be motorized so that it can be 
controlled remotely. In terms of remote control, I chose SBrick. So 
I also included LEDs in order to achieve as much lighting as possible.

It was important to me to preserve the character of a set from the 
Model Team series while at the same time accommodating the latest 
technology and functions.
